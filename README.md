Okay let me give you the instructions here that candidates will use
# Frontend Technical Assessment

## Getting Started instructions
1. Fork this repository and make a copy of it to your github account.
2. Ensure your forked repository is made public using your settings.
3. Review starter code and understand exisitng structure across the three branches `main`, `feature/drag-drop`, `feature/navigation`.
4. Complete the tasks below.

## Task Brief
This is a 48-hour technical assessment focusing on three main components. Basic scaffolding has been provided i.e. HTML structure with proper classes, basic CSS and JavaScript.

### Task 1
1. Checkout to the `feature/drag-drop` branch locally.
2. Under the main `html` tag do the following:
  - Main Objective here is to ensure that the **Drag and Drop** under the `main` section of the html code works as expected. To achieve this, do the following;
    - Improve CSS styling to reflect what is seen on the screen shot [Drag and Drop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16l6xC55Bsopi_C9q7Rau28yvyTsyVLn6/view?usp=drive_link).
    - Ensure drag and drop functionality works (when someone clicks _item1_, _item2_ or _item3_ they can drag it and place it in the designated section as highlighted in the video) [Drag & Drop Functionality](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13UeM2nJfwKjcMUR8d6lsQsiPTSN38ykw/view?usp=drive_link)
    - Ensure animation is efficient (animations don't freeze)
    - NB: No external third party animation libraries are required.

  - Main objective here is to ensure that the **Blog List** under the `main` section of the html code works as expected by;
    - Ensuring the component looks like the video [Blog List Operations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PU_ezhq1s3onaMSJcOwRsoz8pdz4zC5f/view?usp=drive_link).
    - At every given render ensure 10 blogs from the external link are included: `https://frontend-blog-lyart.vercel.app/blogsData.json`.
    - Complete the functionality of the dropdown feature that filters blogs by Date, Reading Time and Category as seen in the video. [First Filter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PU_ezhq1s3onaMSJcOwRsoz8pdz4zC5f/view?usp=drive_link)
    - Complete the functionality of the second dropdown (in the middle of first dropdown and search box) that filters blogs by Writing, Gadgets, Startups as shown in the video.[Second Filter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PU_ezhq1s3onaMSJcOwRsoz8pdz4zC5f/view?usp=drive_link)
    - Complete the functionality of the keyword search functionality of the blogs via the title as also shown in the demo video. [Search](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PU_ezhq1s3onaMSJcOwRsoz8pdz4zC5f/view?usp=drive_link)

  - Ensure the entire section looks stylistically like the solution [General Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwMSwv47rR01mc3tRzGUtmBCWo9Byvfp/view?usp=drive_link).
  - Squash your commits to one, resolve any merge conflicts to your main branch, and commit your changes remotely to `feature/drag-drop`.

3. Checkout locally to `feature/navigation` branch.
4. Under the header `html` tag do the following;
  - Create a sticky navigation header that stays at the top while scrolling [Sticky Navigation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UHYS6FvD8NKVFf8JPK5RagTvJc0Tdx73/view?usp=drive_link)
  - When clicking navigation tabs, implement smooth scrolling for the components as highlighted in the video [Smooth Scroll](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UHYS6FvD8NKVFf8JPK5RagTvJc0Tdx73/view?usp=drive_link)
  - Ensure when a particular html section is in view e.g. `Drag and Drop Section` the corresponding navigation tab linked to said section is highlited blue. Ref: [Dynamic Button Highlighting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14aCqRu_OKDWSq1yeLPAOO5UTYUE4LusF/view?usp=drive_link).
  - Make the navigation header mobile responsive
  - Improve the header code to add accessibility via keyboard to ensure Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, Screen reader support, Focus management.

- Ensure the entire section looks stylistically like the solution [General Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwMSwv47rR01mc3tRzGUtmBCWo9Byvfp/view?usp=drive_link).
- Squash your commits to one, resolve any merge conflicts to your main branch, and commit your changes remotely to `feature/navigation`.

### Task 2
1. Merge both `feature/navigation` and `feature/drag-drop` into `main`.

### Submission Instructions
1. Ensure your project repository is made public.
2. Amend the **README** file in the `main` branch to follow this format:

```md
## Implementation Summary
### Completed Features
- [List all completed features]

### Pending Items
- [List any incomplete features]

### Technical Challenges
- [Describe any blockers or issues encountered]

### AI Usage
- [List any AI tools used during your implementation]
```

3. Follow this submision link [Click here](https://forms.gle/1WPuqpcuaWnhaASAA) and provide your email address and the url link to your completed project repository.
4. **It is okay not to have the entire task brief finished by deadline.**
